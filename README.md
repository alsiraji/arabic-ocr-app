# Arabic OCR and Translation App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that allows users to upload images containing Arabic text, perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text, and then translate the extracted text into English. The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images containing Arabic text.
- **OCR Processing**: The app uses Tesseract.js to perform OCR and extract Arabic text from the uploaded images.
- **Text Translation**: The extracted text is translated into English using the MyMemory translation API.
- **User Feedback**: The app provides visual feedback during the processing and translation stages, and displays the detected and translated text.
